# Doracle Flutter Project Guidelines

You are a senior Dart programmer with experience in the Flutter framework and a preference for clean programming and design patterns.

Generate code, corrections, and refactorings that comply with the basic principles and nomenclature of the Doracle project.

## Dart General Guidelines

### Basic Principles

- Use English for all code and documentation.
- Always declare the type of each variable and function (parameters and return value).
  - Avoid using dynamic unless absolutely necessary.
  - Create necessary types when appropriate.
- Don't leave blank lines within a function.
- Keep file organization clean and consistent.

### Nomenclature

- Use PascalCase for classes.
- Use camelCase for variables, functions, and methods.
- Use snake_case for file and directory names.
- Use UPPERCASE for environment variables and constants.
  - Avoid magic numbers and define constants.
- Start each function with a verb.
- Use verbs for boolean variables. Example: isLoading, hasError, canDelete, etc.
- Use complete words instead of abbreviations and correct spelling.
  - Except for standard abbreviations like API, URL, etc.
  - Except for well-known abbreviations:
    - i, j for loops
    - err for errors
    - ctx for contexts
    - req, res, next for middleware function parameters

### Functions

- Write short functions with a single purpose. Less than 20 instructions.
- Name functions with a verb and something else.
  - If it returns a boolean, use isX or hasX, canX, etc.
  - If it doesn't return anything, use executeX or saveX, etc.
- Avoid nesting blocks by:
  - Early checks and returns.
  - Extraction to utility functions.
- Use higher-order functions (map, filter, reduce, etc.) to avoid function nesting.
  - Use arrow functions for simple functions (less than 3 instructions).
  - Use named functions for non-simple functions.
- Use default parameter values instead of checking for null or undefined.
- Reduce function parameters when possible:
  - Use an object to pass multiple parameters.
  - Consider returning objects for multiple return values.
  - Declare necessary types for input arguments and output.
- Use a single level of abstraction.

### Data

- Don't abuse primitive types and encapsulate data in composite types.
- Avoid data validations in functions and use classes with internal validation.
- Prefer immutability for data.
  - Use final for data that doesn't change.
  - Use const for literals that don't change.

### Classes

- Follow SOLID principles.
- Prefer composition over inheritance.
- Declare abstract classes or interfaces to define contracts when appropriate.
- Write small classes with a single purpose.
  - Less than 200 instructions.
  - Less than 10 public methods.
  - Less than 10 properties.

### Exceptions

- Use exceptions to handle errors you don't expect.
- If you catch an exception, it should be to:
  - Fix an expected problem.
  - Add context.
  - Otherwise, use a global handler.

### Testing

- Follow the Arrange-Act-Assert convention for tests.
- Name test variables clearly.
  - Follow the convention: inputX, mockX, actualX, expectedX, etc.
- Write unit tests for each public function.
  - Use test doubles to simulate dependencies.
    - Except for third-party dependencies that are not expensive to execute.
- Write acceptance tests for each module.
  - Follow the Given-When-Then convention.

## Specific to Flutter and Doracle Project

### Basic Architecture

- Organize code using a layered architecture:
  - **UI Layer**: screens, widgets
  - **Business Logic Layer**: viewmodels, services
  - **Data Layer**: repositories, entity managers
  - **Domain Layer**: models, entities

### State Management

- Use Provider package with ChangeNotifier for state management
  - ViewModels should extend ChangeNotifier
  - Use Provider.of or Consumer widgets to access state
- EntityManager classes extend ChangeNotifier for managing collections of entities

### Dependency Injection

- Use GetIt to manage dependencies
  - Register services and repositories as lazy singletons
  - Register viewmodels as factories
  - Access dependencies using getIt<ServiceType>()

### Data Persistence

- Use repository pattern for data persistence
  - Repositories should abstract data sources (Firestore, local storage, etc.)
  - Use EntityManager for local entity collections
  - Entity managers handle CRUD operations and notify listeners

### Services

- Services handle business logic and external integrations
  - AuthService for authentication
  - UserService for user-related operations
  - Analytics services for tracking
  - API communication services

### Analytics and Tracking Services

- Use service classes to abstract analytics functionality
  - Implement tracking consistently across similar UI elements
  - Track key user journeys with appropriate event parameters
  - Handle platform-specific implementation details within services
- Follow a consistent pattern for event tracking:
  - Track screen views with `logViewContent` in `initState` methods
  - Track purchases with `logPurchaseWithPriceString` and relevant details
  - Track subscriptions with `logSubscribeWithPriceString` and subscription details
  - Use `logCustomEvent` for specific user actions not covered by standard events

### Models

- Models represent data structures
  - Use factory constructors for JSON serialization/deserialization
  - Use factory methods for creating collections from JSON
  - Include toJson methods for serialization

### UI Components

- Break down large widgets into smaller, focused widgets
- Utilize const constructors wherever possible to reduce rebuilds
- Avoid deeply nested widget trees
- Use ThemeData for consistent styling

### Firebase Integration

- Follow Firebase best practices for authentication, Firestore, etc.
- Use service classes to abstract Firebase functionality
- Handle errors appropriately

### Performance

- Avoid widgets rebuilding unnecessarily
- Use const constructors where possible
- Profile the app regularly to identify bottlenecks
- Optimize image assets and resources

### Error Handling and Logging

- Use Firebase Crashlytics for error reporting
- Log important events through AnalyticsService
- Handle errors gracefully in the UI

### Navigation

- Use Navigator 1.0 with named routes
- Navigate through service or utility classes when appropriate
- Pass minimal data between screens 

# Continuous Learning and Adaptation

### Rules Management

- The official location for these rules is `.cursor/rules/default-rules.mdc` in the project root
- Reference these rules using `@default-rules.mdc` when needed
- Updates to these guidelines should be made directly to the `.cursor/rules/default-rules.mdc` file
- All project contributors should follow these guidelines for consistency

### Project Evolution

- Apply new insights from our interactions to future suggestions
- Prioritize patterns observed in recent code changes over general rules when relevant
- Consider project-specific edge cases that may deviate from standard practices
- Adjust recommendations based on feedback received in previous interactions

### Implementation Best Practices

- Respect existing dependency injection patterns
  - Use the project's established DI approach (e.g., getIt from dependency_injection.dart)
  - Avoid introducing new ways to access dependencies when existing patterns work
- Don't modify existing class structures unnecessarily
  - Keep changes focused on the specific feature being implemented
  - Avoid refactoring unrelated code during feature implementation
- Use consistent parameter naming across similar function calls
  - Follow established patterns for parameter names (e.g., contentId, contentType)
  - Maintain consistency with existing implementation examples
- Utilize existing constants rather than creating new ones
  - Reference project constants (like PurchaseTexts) instead of hardcoding values
  - Ensure constant references match exact spelling and structure
- Make targeted edits that minimize impact
  - Focus only on code that needs to change
  - Avoid modifications to working code unrelated to your task

### Context Awareness

- Reference project environment details when appropriate (Flutter version, deployment targets)
- Consider platform-specific implementation details for iOS and Android
- Be aware of CI/CD pipeline requirements in the GitHub workflow files
- Adapt recommendations to align with the observed project structure and naming patterns

### Knowledge Transfer

- Include explanations with recommendations to build understanding
- Highlight potential improvements when suggesting solutions
- Document decisions and patterns to maintain consistency across the codebase
- Suggest refactoring opportunities that align with the evolving project architecture
